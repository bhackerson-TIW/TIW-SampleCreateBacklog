# Product Goal

A product can have multiple product goals, and a team should only be working on a singular product goal at a time.  The Product Goal should be limited to information about **what** the product goal should be, and not include implementation details.

# Example

** Use AI-Driven Development to Shape The Intertech Way Playbook
Deliver an internal software product built with AI collaboration, helping define reusable patterns and practices that will become core to The Intertech Way playbook. **
