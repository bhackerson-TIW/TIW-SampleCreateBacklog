# Glossary of Scrum Terms

This glossary defines important terms and concepts related to Scrum, beyond the basic structure of Scrum's three accountabilities, five events, and three artifacts.  The Scrum Guide definition prevails where there is conflict, as it is the definitive source for the Scrum framework.

- **Swarming**: Focus the entire team on completing one item at a time to finish work faster.
- **Interrupt Pattern**: Allocate a buffer for interruptions to minimize disruption during a Sprint.
- **Daily Clean Code**: Commit to fixing bugs within a day to maintain a high-quality codebase.
- **Emergency Procedure**: A pre-defined response plan for when a Sprint is at risk.
- **Scrumming the Scrum**: Address the most critical impediment each Sprint through a Kaizen item.
