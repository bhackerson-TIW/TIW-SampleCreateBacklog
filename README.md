Background data and prompts facilitating the generation of a product backlog from a series of input markdown files:
1) Product Information - includes Product Canvas, Product Vision, Product Goal and other documents
2) Backlog Standards - follows The Intertech Way product backlog guidelines to maximize the quality of the backlog that is created
3) Scrum Definitions - augments The Scrum Guide to provide definitions of key terms
