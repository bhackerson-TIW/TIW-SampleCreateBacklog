# The Intertech Way: Product Backlog Guidelines

# User Story Quality Standards

Each backlog item must have a title, description, and an acceptance criteria.  This description should provide enough information to meet the INVEST criteria:
•	Independent: The backlog item should be self-contained and not dependent on other items.
•	Negotiable: The item should be open to discussion and not a rigid contract.
•	Valuable: It must deliver value to the stakeholders.
•	Estimable: The team should be able to estimate the size of the item.
•	Small: The item should be small enough to be completed within a sprint.
•	Testable: The item should have clear acceptance criteria to make it testable

# Story Format

User stories should be written in a Job Story format:
Job stories downplay personas in favor of motivation. Personas can be added later. Here are some examples:
•	When the nightly batch process finishes, automatically generate a status report to be sent via email, so that a list of passes and failures is shared as needed.
•	When the GetAddress() procedure is invoked, get NewData from the vendor API, so that the data can be stored in the Cust_Info table.

# Other Guidelines

The stories will not have estimates when they are created
The stories should include one or more keywords to assist with grouping
